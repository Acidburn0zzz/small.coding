Manage KVM instances
====================

The base directory is ${IMAGE_LOCATION}::
  ${IMAGE_LOCATION}
  +- ${TEMPLATE_LOCATION}
  `- ${TARGET_LOCATION}

Inside the base directory, a hosts file equivalent to an /etc/hosts is used as
the "owner" of all data. The related fields are all devised from the IPv6
address.

The MAC address of the image is 11:22:33:40:<NUM> with <NUM> being the sequence
number of the virtual image. This also means that the IPv6 address is
automatically known (based on the 2001:db8:81:e2:0200 prefix).

The VNC number is <NUM> + 10.
The GDB number is <NUM> + 1299.

Specifics
---------

Images are configured to set hostname ("env force_hostname=YES" in
/etc/dhcpc.conf).

Eix is configured to update cache (PORTDIR_CACHE_METHOD="parse" in /etc/eixrc).

In local.d, the nfs start/stop is set with::
  mount -a -t nfs4;
  cat /proc/mounts > /etc/mtab;
and vice versa.

The ''/proc/mounts'' content must be copied to ''/etc/mtab'' so umounts work as
expected.
