gxml2docbook
============

The gxml2docbook.xsl file is a XSL transformation that will attempt to 
transform a Gentoo GuideXML Book format into a docbook format, ready to be
processed with tools like docbook2latex and so forth.

It is currently extremely basic and lacking a lot of features, but for simple
books (i.e. all non-main handbooks) it does the job nicely.

gxml2wiki
=========

The gxml2wiki.xsl file is a XSL transformation that will attempt to transform a
Gentoo GuideXML file into the wiki format as used on https://wiki.gentoo.org.
