gxml2docbook
============

The gxml2docbook.xsl file is a XSL transformation that will attempt to 
transform a Gentoo GuideXML Book format into a docbook format, ready to be
processed with tools like docbook2latex and so forth.

It is currently extremely basic and lacking a lot of features, but for simple
books (i.e. all non-main handbooks) it does the job nicely.
