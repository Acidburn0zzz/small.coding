Support dracut domain

While trying to get a SELinux-supporting initramfs booted up (in enforcing
mode, without unconfined domains) my current attempts are at dracut. But
dracut itself didn't work quite well on such a system as running it in
sysadm_t domain fails (some domain transitions occur which are then asked to
write files in user_tmp_t which isn't allowed for those domains).

Instead of patching those domains (ldconfig_t and depmod_t) to allow writing
& creating files in user_tmp_t (i.e. manage privileges) I drafted up a
dracut domain (dracut_t) and grant those domains manage access to
dracut_tmp_t.

To support dracut, a few changes were necessary to the policy as well
(additional interfaces).

Changes since v2
----------------
- Add search on etc_t and udev_var_run_t through the udev_read_rules_files
  interface
- Update dracut_manage_tmp_files to become dracut_rw_tmp_files
- Reduce file transitions to directory class only (within tmp)
- Use corecmd_mmap_all_executables to allow dracut to use "ldd" to get
  dependency info
