Mark the pid directory as a pid directory

Currently, the policy has the pid directory itself marked as the postfix_spool_t
type. However, when mails are delivered, several postfix daemons need to
add/remove their PID files. It makes much more sense to mark this location as
postfix_var_run_t rather than having file transitions for all these daemons when
they write their PID file.
