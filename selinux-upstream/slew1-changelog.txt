Updates on init scripts and udev (mainly /run related)

This is a larger set of structured changes to the system
utilities. The main drivers are supporting the new /run location,
but some smaller changes have been incorporated as well.

Changes since v4
----------------
- Drop files_create_pid_dirs for initrc_t, can be handled through
  different transitions

Changes since v3
----------------
- Change udev_pid_filetrans_run_dirs to udev_generic_pid_filetrans_run_dirs

Changes since v2
----------------
- Allow initrc_t to manage its log files too
- Remove sysctl code (that needed the sys_admin), will be part of different
  patchset

Changes since v1
----------------
- Use var_lock_t in the gen_require of files_pid_filetrans_lock_dir

Gentoo patches:
- 0024 (initrc_var_log_t)
- 0078 (initrc sys_admin for sysctl)
- 0110 partially (init & udev /run)
