Recent postfix releases have their binaries at /usr/libexec instead of /usr/lib.
This patch removes the ifdef for distro_redhat since, even for distributions
that would still have the old locations, having the definitions for the contexts
loaded doesn't hurt.

Add in a small blurb too to reflect the potential deprecation of said contexts.
