At startup, postfix creates the missing queue directories inside
/var/spool/postfix. This is done by the master process. However, since the
/var/spool/postfix directory is labeled postfix_spool_t and there were no named
file transitions, all created queues became postfix_spool_t. This meant that an
administrator had to relabel the directories afterwards.

This patch adds in the necessary named file transitions for those directories,
create privileges for the master domain and setattr (to change directory
ownership).

Also add in the fowner capability for the master domain, needed for running
chown on the queue's.
