Introduce substitution for /usr/local/lib* and /etc/init.d

This patchset contains the suggestion to also have a substitition for
/usr/local/lib* towards /usr/lib since manually installed applications use
/usr/local/lib* for their libraries (instead of /usr/lib) but *should* have the
same structure otherwise.

This is not only to clean up the defined file contexts a bit (there are not that
many references to /usr/local) but mainly to support such installed applications
almost out-of-the-box with our policies.

A second substitution is for init scripts defined in /etc/init\.d, which we now
map to /etc/rc\.d/init\.d (already used in the majority of cases in the policy).
For those distributions that do use /etc/init\.d though they need to take care
to always use /etc/rc\.d/init\.d since the translation (substitution) takes
precedence before the file contexts are looked at.
