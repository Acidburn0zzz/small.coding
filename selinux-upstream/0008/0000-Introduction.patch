Subject: [PATCH v3 0/3] Support read/append/manage functions for various httpd content

Within this patch set, we make the web content types as defined by the apache
module more generic in use so that other domains, who need to interact with
these types, can do so without getting too many privileges assigned (like with
apache_manage_all_content).

Since v2, the following changes have been incorporated:
- Use double comment for phpfpm's summary

Since v1, the following changes have been incorporated:
- Adding apache_search_all_content within the apache_append_all_ra_content_files
  interface
- Adding phpfpm_t domain as an example user for these interfaces

With thanks to Dominick Grift for his feedback.
