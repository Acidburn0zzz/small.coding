Allow maildelivery to use dotlock files in the mail spool

When a mail delivery server wants to append mails to the users' mail spool file,
it might also use dotlock files in order to "lock" access to the mail spool
file. This requires the domain file managing rights (create/write/remove) within
the mta_spool_t resource.

Note that this isn't needed if only fcntl locking is used, but most mail
delivery services use dotlock locking as well. Also, since the lock files are
named <username>.lock we cannot create file transitions (towards a lock type) as
we cannot mention the filenames up front.
