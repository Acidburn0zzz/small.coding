    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>As an active contributor to the Gentoo Hardened project with regard
    to SELinux support (both documentation, policy development and ebuilds) I
    find it important to have a good testing approach. Thanks to
    virtualization efforts such as KVM, it is possible to generate a
    semi-automated testing environment, allowing me to test various setups and
    installations before considering contributions stable enough.</para>

    <para>Of course, why using semi-automated testing rather than fully
    automated? Well, I'm probably going to automate more and more to the point
    it is fully automated, but for the time being, it is a semi-automated
    approach ;-)</para>

    <section>
      <title>Testing Overview</title>

      <para>The following table shows the tests that I execute. Most tests are
      based on the documentation offered by Gentoo, which also means that I
      occasionally have to review the scripts to see if they still follow the
      instructions (as documentation changes over time).</para>

    <title>Stage3 Hardened Installation</title>

    <para>This test performs a hardened installation in a virtual environment.
    At the end, we should have a bootable virtual environment with a small but
    functional hardened system (with pax/grsecurity hardening active)
    inside.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Steps</title>

      <para>The stage3 hardened installation uses a 20Gbyte qemu image (qcow2
      format):</para>

      <programlisting>~$ <command>qemu-img create -f qcow2 test.img 20G</command></programlisting>

      <para>This image is booted using the system rescue CD ISO:</para>

      <programlisting>~$ <command>qemu-system-x86_64 --enable-kvm -net nic,model=virtio,macaddr=00:11:22:33:44:a0,vlan=0 \
 -net vde,vlan=0 -drive file=test.img,if=virtio,boot=on -usb -usbdevice tablet -smp 2 \
 -k nl-be -m 1024 -boot d -cdrom systemrescuecd-x86-2.0.0.iso</command></programlisting>

      <para>The virtual drive (vda) is formatted with a root partition (vda1,
      ext4), a swap partition and a physical group (vda3) for LVM2. A volume
      group is then created with usr, home, opt and var as logical
      volumes.</para>

      <programlisting>~# <command>df -hT</command>

      <para>During the Gentoo installation, the following settings are
      used.</para>

        <thead>
          <tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Profile = hardened/linux/amd64</td>

          <td>The Portage profile selected during the installation is the
          "hardened/linux/amd64" profile.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>USE = -ldap -gtk -xorg -ipv6 -pppd</td>

          <td>The USE flags are modified slightly to keep the number of
          package dependencies to a minimum.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>clock/TIMEZONE = Europe/Brussels</td>

          <td>The timezone is set to Europe/Brussels</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>keymaps/KEYMAP = be-latin1</td>

          <td>The keymap is set to be-latin1</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>net/config_eth0 = ( "dhcp" )</td>

          <td>The network configuration uses DHCP</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>/etc/locale.gen only en_US (ISO-8859-15 and UTF-8)</td>

          <td>The number of locales to be generated by glibc installation is
          limited to the en_US ones.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <para>Also, the following packages are installed:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>mdadm (as I hope to extend the installation later to use two
          virtual disks in software RAID-1 configuration)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>lvm2 (as the installation uses LVM2)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>syslog-ng (system logger), this one is also added to the
          default runlevel. During the installation, "<command>unset
          path</command>" is executed (otherwise the installation of syslog-ng
          fails).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>dhcpcd (DHCP client)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>grub (bootloader)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>layman (to add overlays)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>vim (personal favorite editor)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>git (for client)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>eix (portage package information caching)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>hardened-sources (kernel sources)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The kernel configuration/build itself is premade (occasionally,
      the Linux kernel build is done and a binary package is created which can
      then be reused across all virtual instances) so is not actually
      tested.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Deviations</title>

      <para>A few deviations are in place from a standard installation. These
      deviations are occasionally cleared to ensure that no wrong assumptions
      are made.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A local mirror is included to speed up the downloading of
          source packages. If a source package is absent on the Internet but
          available on the local mirror, we will not catch this error. To
          remediate this, the local mirror is sometimes disabled.</para>
