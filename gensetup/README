gensetup
========

The gensetup script allows you to automatically install a Gentoo Linux system. I
use it to "seed" my virtual images the moment I want to test something. The
script is not self-explanatory and the configuration file it uses only
marginally. I intend to rewrite it in some near future to be more properly
documented.

It is not meant to be used on production systems and definitely not as a
replacement for the GLIS (Gentoo Linux Installation Script) or whatever it was
called when it was still alive.

The only supported installation method for Gentoo Linux remains the manual
approach as documented in the handbook !
