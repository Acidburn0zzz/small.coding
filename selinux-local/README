selinux-local
=============

At the base directory, you will find fixlocal.te which makes some small
system-level changes which I do not feel belong inside a (reusable) module (but
I can be mistaken).

In refpol_patches you can find the patches that I incorporate in the current
2.20101213 reference policy in order to have my system up and running (in
enforcing mode, strict). They are still under development (after adding stuff in
order to get things working, I also need to start removing stuff again to see if
things still work then).
