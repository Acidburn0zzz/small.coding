[1] Refpolicy would like to see an intermediate domain (udev_network_initrc_t or something similar) which
    has the domtrans in it. In our case, this probably means that the udev "net.sh" script should use that.
    However, the patch is, imo (SwifT) fairly simple as-is so I suggest to keep it this way.
