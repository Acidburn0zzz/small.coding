SELinux Policy Patches
======================

This directory contains the list of patches applied to the refpolicy. The
patches are either in the form of "fix-<category>-<module>-r<revision>.patch"
or "<changeset>-<module>-<description>-r<revision>.patch"

The used <revision> helps identify in which patchbundle a patch(set) is
included.

Support for named initrc_t domains (cfr http://dpaste.com/594913/)

Change sets in this patch bundle
--------------------------------

The following is the list of changesets in the patch bundle. A "-" means that
the patch is currently Gentoo-only. A "+" means that the patch is accepted
upstream (refpolicy) and as such should not need to be re-applied if a new
refpolicy release is made. A "." means that the patch is pending (submitted but
not yet approved). An "!" means that the patch will not be sent upstream
(anymore) and "=" means it is merged in a later patch

0001 ! udev can call networking scripts directly (for hotplugging reasons) [1]
0002 - introduce XDG types (user data and configuration directories)
0003 - add mutt declaration and update gpg to interact with mutt
0004 - add pan declaration
0005 . add links declaration
0006 - add skype declaration
0007 - add gorg declaration
0008 - add nginx declaration
0009 ! various corecommands file contexts updates [mainly openrc stuff, review later, already quite outdated with newest changes]
0010 . mount requires relabelfrom rights as well to support non-standard mounts like /usr/portage
0011 . allow mount to read/write puppet tmp files (used to gather output of mount)
0012 . allow syslog to create /var/lib/syslog
0013 - use runtime files for gcc-config (+ tmp support for "tac" command)
0014 . add vde declaration
0015 - update on fail2ban (start from initrc_t), dontaudit for python scripts wanting to write .pyc files where .py files are
0017 . updates for init (partial)
     - updates for init 
0018 - update on udev, later versions manage the udev_tbl_t more than just files
0019 - allow initrc_t to create dirs in /sys (some init scripts do this), we might want to change to named filetrans later here
0020 - allow portage_fetch_t to use portage_devpts_t, show progress of downloads for instance
0021 . update syslog file contexts for .persist- file
0022 - allow exports (under initrc_t) to manage state data for NFS
0023 - update on puppet policy
0025 - update on courier policy
0026 - update on openldap policy
0028 - update on xserver policy
0029 - make cron domains use interactive file descriptors (?)
0031 . introduce generic attributes for apache and web content handling [also 0102]
0032 - mark /dev/.lvm as the lvm lockdir dir (default in gentoo)
0033 - add domtrans for rc_exec_t in init_domtrans_script (needed for init_t to rc)
0034 ! temporarily reintroduce gentoo booleans (remove on 01/07/2012)
0035 - allow mount and su to get attribute of security_t, needed for mounting with rootcontext option or running su [2]
0036 - allow sysadmin to call qemu
0037 - mark /var/lib/ip6tables as initrc_tmp_t, needed by ip6tables init script
0038 - allow nginx_t to list the contents of its configuration directories
0039 - mark /lib/rc/console as initrc_state_t so that init script can clean stuff in there
0040 - selinux-aware applications check for selinux file system on /selinux (security_t) but also inside /sys (sysfs_t)
0041 - remove domtrans when calling rc_exec_t to initrc_t, gentoo init system already supports integrated run_init (runscript_selinux.so is a modified run_init), all it needs is execute rights on rc_exec_t and "wait" until initrc_exec_t is called.
0042 - do not audit searches on unlabeled_t by kernel_t (during mount) right before the mount on that dir occurs (like with cgroups)
0043 - allow mount to setsched kernel
0044 - allow bootmisc init script to mkdir/rmdir in /var/lib
0045 - allow initrc scripts to delete stale syslog control sockets in /var/run
0046 - allow initrc script to clean up /tmp
0047 - do not audit search/getattr on user_home_dir from within portage_fetch domain
0048 - allow initscripts to manipulate sysctls (sys_admin capability)
0049 - do not audit sys_admin capability for dhcpc (since kernel between 3.1.6 and 3.2.2)
0050 ! allow cronie (crond_t) to create cronjob_t keys (needed to run cronjobs by cronie) [3]
0051 - mark pwd.lck as etc_t so that recent shadow utilities can work with it
0052 - allow init scripts to manage cgroup files and directories (openrc requirement)
0053 - support calling startx(fce4) from console for unconfined_t (transition to xserver_t)
0054 - Mark kudzu call as optional in ddcprobe
0055 - Allow kdevtmpfs to setattr on its device files
0056 - Mark /etc/selinux/*/modules as semanage_store_t
0057 ! Update udev file contexts (already outdated)
0058 - dontaudit dmesg accessing generic device_t chr_file (/dev/console when not relabeled yet)
0059 - fix build failures by marking stuff optional (inetd, apache, ...)
0060 . support search on all web content in apache (part of 0054)
0061 . introduce phpfpm_t domain
0062 - Use gnome_xdg_config_t for gnome config in ~/.config
0063 - Introduce dracut domain
0064 - wpa_cli is an interactive application
0065 - add gentoo_portage_eselect_module interface
0069 - support proper userspace confinement
0074 - various dontaudits
0081 - allow sysadmin to be postfix admin
0087 - label kmod as insmod_exec_t
0088 - allow udev to load kernel modules
0089 - update contexts for publicfile

0093 - allow sysadm to manage asterisk service
0094 - remove named_var_lib_t reference
0097 - mark /etc/env.d generally as runtime files (gcc-config needed)
0099 - allow sysadm to manage openvpn
0100 - allow sysadm to manage bind
0101 - allow sysadm to manage ntp
0105 - introduce puppet_admin and puppet_admin_puppetmaster interfaces
0106 - allow lvm_t (cryptsetup) to request loading a cryptography-related module
0107 - dbus wants to set its max number of open file descriptors
0109 - consolekit creates /var/run/console tagfiles triggered through its pam connector
0110 - mark the syslog-ng.persist file as the syslogd_var_lib_t file too to it survives a relabel
0111 - consolekit reads dbus info
0130 = merge set from 20120725

[1] Refpolicy would like to see an intermediate domain (udev_network_initrc_t or something similar) which
    has the domtrans in it. In our case, this probably means that the udev "net.sh" script should use that.
    However, the patch is, imo (SwifT) fairly simple as-is so I suggest to keep it this way.
[2] Without, su fails with "Authentication service cannot retrieve
    authentication info". We notice that it wants to get the attribute on security_t
    and then stops. In permissive mode, I notice that it calls the chpwd binary (as
    expected). 
[3] I don't think it is needed. The cronie sourcecode does check for setkeycreate rights, but there is no need 
    for it later in the code. We might want to patch cronie instead not to check
    for the keys anymore? Yes, patch accepted upstream, need to validate in
    future releases if/when we can remove it from the policy again.
