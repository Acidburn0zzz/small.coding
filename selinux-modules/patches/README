SELinux Policy Patches
======================

This directory contains the list of patches applied to the refpolicy. The
patches are either in the form of "fix-<category>-<module>-r<revision>.patch"
or "<changeset>-<module>-<description>-r<revision>.patch"

The used <revision> helps identify in which patchbundle a patch(set) is
included.

Outstanding Issues
------------------

Support for named initrc_t domains (cfr http://dpaste.com/594913/)

Change sets in this patch bundle
--------------------------------

The following is the list of changesets in the patch bundle. A "-" means that
the patch is currently Gentoo-only. A "+" means that the patch is accepted
upstream (refpolicy) and as such should not need to be re-applied if a new
refpolicy release is made. A "." means that the patch is pending (submitted but
not yet approved).

0080 - mark remotelogin_domtrans call in telnet as optional (no hard dependency)
0081 - add virtualization context files
0082 - allow virtd to read the selinux config (etc/selinux/config) as libselinux needs this to find out the correct SELINUXTYPE= value (cfr call to selinux_virtual_domain_context_path)
0083 - ensure that libvirt can be started properly by initrc_t
0084 - update virtualization so that sysadmin can use tools like virsh
0085 - drop compatibility rules for baselayout versus openrc (cfr 0035)
0086 - allow creation of user keys by sudo, needed for sudo with selinux integration
0087 - dontaudit search activities on domain state information (/proc/*/) for xserver
0088 - dontaudit use of unix_stream_socket for mail (mta_send_mail), like already supported through fifo
0089 . introduce bacula domain
0090 . have sshd use the mkhomedir_helper through the oddjob domains
0091 - support generic attributes for apache
0092 - dontaudit fd usage by dbus session users
0093 - dontaudit getattr on filesystems by firefox (mozilla)
0094 - dontaudit fd usage by ifconfig on wpa_cli descriptors
0095 - dontaudit unix_stream_socket usage by hostname_t on dhcpc_t descriptors

[1] Refpolicy would like to see an intermediate domain (udev_network_initrc_t or something similar) which
    has the domtrans in it. In our case, this probably means that the udev "net.sh" script should use that.
    However, the patch is, imo (SwifT) fairly simple as-is so I suggest to keep it this way.
