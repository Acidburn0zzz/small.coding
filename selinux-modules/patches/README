Change sets in this patch bundle
--------------------------------

The following is the list of changesets in the patch bundle. A "-" means that
the patch is currently Gentoo-only. A "+" means that the patch is accepted
upstream (refpolicy) and as such should not need to be re-applied if a new
refpolicy release is made. A "." means that the patch is pending (submitted but
not yet approved). An "!" means that the patch will not be sent upstream
(anymore).

0001 ! udev can call networking scripts directly (for hotplugging reasons) [1]
0002 - introduce XDG types (user data and configuration directories)
0003 - add mutt declaration and update gpg to interact with mutt
0004 - add pan declaration
0005 . add links declaration
0006 - add skype declaration
0007 - add gorg declaration
0008 - add nginx declaration
0009 + add bacula declaration
0010 + dontaudit set 1
0012 ! various corecommands file contexts updates [mainly openrc stuff, review later, already quite outdated with newest changes]
0014 . mount requires relabelfrom rights as well to support non-standard mounts like /usr/portage
0015 . allow mount to read/write puppet tmp files (used to gather output of mount)
0016 + mark portage_ebuild_t as a mountpoint
0017 + mark debugfs_t as a mountpoint
0018 - allow syslog to create /var/lib/syslog
0019 + structured set of patches for asterisk
0020 + mark glsa-check as portage entry file
0021 + allow gcc_config_t to work with nfs-mounted portage tree
0022 - use runtime files for gcc-config (+ tmp support for "tac" command)
0023 . add vde declaration
0024 - bootmisc wants to write (temporarily) to /var/log. Support logging_manage_generic_log_dirs
0025 + Mark /dev/.tmp-block-.* as fixed_disk_device_t so that mdadm can work on it (file is created by udev as $tempnode)
0026 - update on fail2ban (start from initrc_t), dontaudit for python scripts wanting to write .pyc files where .py files are
0027 - mark remotelogin_domtrans call in telnet as optional (no hard dependency)
0028 + add virtualization context files
0029 + allow virtd to read the selinux config (etc/selinux/config) as libselinux needs this to find out the correct SELINUXTYPE= value (cfr call to selinux_virtual_domain_context_path)
0030 + ensure that initrc can connect to the virt sockets
0031 + update virtualization so that sysadmin can use tools like virsh
0032 - updates for init
0033 + allow creation of user keys by sudo, needed for sudo with selinux integration
0034 + do not have java-config be marked as a java_t entry point
0036 . update on udev, later versions manage the udev_tbl_t more than just files
0037 + lvm now uses setfscreate for tools like pvscan, vgscan, vgchange, probably through the libudev binding
0038 - allow initrc_t to create dirs in /sys (some init scripts do this), we might want to change to named filetrans later here
0039 - allow portage_fetch_t to use portage_devpts_t, show progress of downloads for instance
0040 + allow portage_sandbox_t to use git (git-2 eclass)
0041 - update syslog file contexts for .persist- file
0042 - allow exports (under initrc_t) to manage state data for NFS

0046 - update on courier policy
0047 - update on openldap policy
0048 - update on postfix policy
0049 - update on postgresql policy
0050 - update on xserver policy
0051 - make cron domains use interactive file descriptors (?)
0052 + dhcpd can use ldap as backend
0053 - allow mozilla plugin to read its configuration files (currently still very generic)
0054 . introduce generic attributes for apache and web content handling [also 0102]
0055 - mark /dev/.lvm as the lvm lockdir dir (default in gentoo)
0056 - add domtrans for rc_exec_t in init_domtrans_script (needed for init_t to rc)
0057 + expand selinux and usermanage role usage to include the proper type definitions
0058 ! temporarily reintroduce gentoo booleans (remove on 01/07/2012)
0059 - allow mount and su to get attribute of security_t, needed for mounting with rootcontext option or running su [2]
0060 + add port 3128 as http_cache_port_t (default port for squid cache)
0061 - allow sysadmin to call qemu
0062 + mark mozilla_plugin_t as part of the mozilla_roles
0063 + use correct clamav_var_log_t call, not clamav_log_t
0064 - mark /var/lib/ip6tables as initrc_tmp_t, needed by ip6tables init script
0065 - allow nginx_t to list the contents of its configuration directories
0066 - mark /lib/rc/console as initrc_state_t so that init script can clean stuff in there
0067 - selinux-aware applications check for selinux file system on /selinux (security_t) but also inside /sys (sysfs_t)
0068 - remove domtrans when calling rc_exec_t to initrc_t, gentoo init system already supports integrated run_init (runscript_selinux.so is a modified run_init), all it needs is execute rights on rc_exec_t and "wait" until initrc_exec_t is called.
0069 - do not audit searches on unlabeled_t by kernel_t (during mount) right before the mount on that dir occurs (like with cgroups)
0070 - allow mount to setsched kernel
0071 + mark security_t (for /selinux and /sys/fs/selinux) as a mountpoint
0072 - allow bootmisc init script to mkdir/rmdir in /var/lib
0073 - allow initrc scripts to delete stale syslog control sockets in /var/run
0074 - allow initrc script to clean up /tmp

0078 - allow initscripts to manipulate sysctls (sys_admin capability)
0079 - do not audit sys_admin capability for dhcpc (since kernel between 3.1.6 and 3.2.2)
0080 + allow syslog-ng to getsched, needed for newer syslog-ng implementations
0081 ! allow cronie (crond_t) to create cronjob_t keys (needed to run cronjobs by cronie) [3]
0082 - mark pwd.lck as etc_t so that recent shadow utilities can work with it
0083 - allow init scripts to manage cgroup files and directories (openrc requirement)
0084 - support calling startx(fce4) from console for unconfined_t (transition to xserver_t)
0085 + introduce tunable support for setrlimit within apache
0086 + update whitespace issues with segenxml.py script to fix python3 issues
0087 + switch to substituted file locations (subs_dist)
0088 + allow shadow utils to read default context definitions
0089 + Update symbol in clamav_append_log interface (backport)
0090 + Eliminate "*_except_auth_files" expressions through new attribute
0091 + Introduce named file transition support (backport)
0092 + Remove duplicate context definition for firefox

0110 - Support /run directory for udev and init
0111 - Introduce dracut domain
0112 - wpa_cli is an interactive application
0113 + packagekit context updates (backport)
0114 + Backporting some support related commits
0115 - allow udev init scripts to create data & rules.d with correct label
0116 + Add in bcfg policy (backport)
0117 + Add in blueman policy (backport)
0118 + nss_domain attribute patch (backport)
0119 - add gentoo_portage_eselect_module interface
0120 - udevd new location since systemd
0121 - allow dhcpc to create /var/run/dhcpc (done through dhcpcd-hooks)
0122 - allow init to create dbus run dirs in /run
0123 . allow nslcd to connect to LDAP
0124 - add in policy for chromium
0125 + culminated set of upstream patches

[1] Refpolicy would like to see an intermediate domain (udev_network_initrc_t or something similar) which
    has the domtrans in it. In our case, this probably means that the udev "net.sh" script should use that.
    However, the patch is, imo (SwifT) fairly simple as-is so I suggest to keep it this way.
[2] Without, su fails with "Authentication service cannot retrieve
    authentication info". We notice that it wants to get the attribute on security_t
    and then stops. In permissive mode, I notice that it calls the chpwd binary (as
    expected). 
[3] I don't think it is needed. The cronie sourcecode does check for setkeycreate rights, but there is no need 
    for it later in the code. We might want to patch cronie instead not to check
    for the keys anymore? Yes, patch accepted upstream, need to validate in
    future releases if/when we can remove it from the policy again.
