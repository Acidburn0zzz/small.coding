/topic resolv
The /etc/resolv.conf file contains the list of name servers that Linux 
needs to query when it wants to resolve DNS names (like www.gentoo.org)
towards their IP address. If the file is empty or does not contain any
"nameserver" definitions, then name resolving will not work.

A correct example for this file would be:
  nameserver 8.8.8.8
  nameserver 192.168.100.1

Although the resolv.conf file in your Gentoo installation is copied in
chapter 6, it is created earlier in the installation (chapter 3).
