Small Coding
============

the small.coding repository contains small tools, scripts, XML/XSL sets, 
javascript and others which are all licensed under the GPL-3 license (as far as
it needs to be licensed, some scripts are too small to be licensed and are in
the public domain).

The following directories are available:

genmodoverview - Script to inform you which sec-policy/* packages you might need
gensetup - Script to automatically install a Gentoo Linux system
gxml2docbook - XSL conversion script from Gentoo GuideXML Book format to DocBook
