genmodoverview
==============

The genmodoverview script scans your system for files that are listed in the 
reference policy (that Gentoo Hardened uses) as requiring a specific type.
This hints you, as security administrator, about potential sec-policy/* 
packages that you might need.

For instance:

  ~# ./genmodoverview.sh -c LISTING
  shutdown
  xserver

In this case, you might want to install sec-policy/selinux-shutdown and
sec-policy/selinux-xserver.
